# My Vimrc

This repository is where I keep my vimrc

To install on your own, run the install.sh script to automatically create sym links in your home directory.
I use sym links so whenever pulls or commits are made the configs are auto-magically update
use the -f option with install.sh to remove the previous file and create a new link
